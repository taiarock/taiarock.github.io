# taiarock.github.io


I made this github account to be able to participate in Hackatons, help friends'open source projects, and to apply the bite-size knowledge that I have in Git, HTML, CSS and Sass. (Now I know I little bit of JS).

The project above (http://taiarock.github.io/) is my old portfolio made by the "past Taia", who didn't know about the magic of Sass. Before learning about it, I didn't know that code could be so beautiful, organized and simple to mantain! 

So, the plan was to apply everything new I was learning into refactoring all stylesheets of my portfolio, in order to learn by doing. In the end, I would have less work, since it would be easier to mantain.

Editor's note 1: The truth is that I didn't have time to finish all pages, but I'm very happy with all that I did until now.

Editor's note 2: This previous portfolio was more related to the User Interface side of my career, while the new one is a complete new approach in User Expirience and Information Architecture. You can check it at www.taia.rocks.
